# Outline 
For my final project, I will focus on the topic of Women’s Rights and Empowerment, specifically examining how women's rights have evolved globally in political, economic, and social spheres. My goal is to use data visualization to illustrate the progress women have made in terms of political representation, workforce participation, maternity and parental leave, and legal rights. The project will also highlight the ongoing challenges women face through global data comparisons.

I believe this topic is compelling because it allows for an intersectional exploration of gender, law, and societal progress. Using data visualization, I aim to inform the audience about global disparities in women’s rights and showcase both achievements and areas where further progress is needed.

## Project Structure
1. The Awakening of Rights: Women’s Political Representation
Story focus: This section will highlight the historical progress of women’s suffrage and the growing representation of women in politics. It will show how gaining the right to vote was the foundation for broader political empowerment, but that there is still a gap in representation in government.

2. The Persistent Wage Gap: Economic Inequality
Story focus: This part will explore the continuing issue of the gender wage gap, focusing on how despite legal advances, women still earn less than men across most industries. The wage gap remains a critical barrier to true economic equality.

3. Law Mandates Equal Pay: Progress in Legislation
Story focus: This section will examine how many countries have introduced legislation requiring equal pay for work of equal value, but also point out the disconnect between legislation and its effective enforcement in many regions.

4. Motherhood and the Workforce: Balancing Care and Career
Story focus: Highlighting the challenges mothers face in balancing their professional careers and caregiving responsibilities. It will compare different countries' maternity and paternity leave policies and show how these policies impact women's long-term career prospects.

5. Cultural Challenges: Societal Norms vs. Legal Rights
Story focus: Even with strong legal protections, cultural attitudes often prevent real progress. This section will highlight societal beliefs that still justify violence against women, illustrating the cultural barriers that remain despite legal advancements.

Conclusion: The Road Ahead
While significant progress has been made in the fight for women’s rights, there remains a long road ahead. Political representation has increased, but economic inequality persists, and cultural attitudes continue to limit women’s freedom and safety. Through this project, I aim to illustrate these complex intersections between law, culture, and women’s rights, using data to inform and inspire further action toward true gender equality.

# The data
For this project, I will be using data from several publicly accessible and reputable sources to provide a comprehensive view of women's rights and gender equality across multiple dimensions. Below are the primary data sources and how I plan on utilizing them.

| Name | URL | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| Share of women in parliament | https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-women-in-parliament?tab=chart | Will be used in 'the Awakening of Rights' Part |
| Gender wage gap |https://www.oecd.org/en/data/indicators/gender-wage-gap.html | Will be in the ' The Persistent Wage Gap' Part|
| Law Mandates Equal Pay |https://databank.worldbank.org/source/gender-statistics#| Will be in the'Law Mandates Equal Pay' Part|
| Days of paid leave for mothers |https://databank.worldbank.org/source/gender-statistics#| Will be in the'Motherhood and the Workforce' Part|
| Days of paid leave for fathers |https://databank.worldbank.org/source/gender-statistics#| Will be in the'Motherhood and the Workforce' Part|
| Share of women who believe a husband is justified in beating his wife |https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/women-believe-husband-justified-beating-wife?time=latest| Will be in the'Cultural Challenges' Part|


# Method and medium
I plan to use Shorthand to make a website page and using Tableau to do Data Visualzation for telling this story.
