# Outline 
For my final project, I will focus on the topic of Women’s Rights and Empowerment, specifically examining how women's rights have evolved globally in political, economic, and social spheres. My goal is to use data visualization to illustrate the progress women have made in terms of political representation, workforce participation, maternity and parental leave, and legal rights. The project will also highlight the ongoing challenges women face, such as the gender wage gap and violence against women, through global data comparisons.

I believe this topic is compelling because it allows for an intersectional exploration of gender, law, and societal progress. Using data visualization, I aim to inform the audience about global disparities in women’s rights and showcase both achievements and areas where further progress is needed.

## Project Structure
1. The Awakening of Rights: Women’s Political Representation
Story focus: This section will highlight the historical progress of women’s suffrage and the growing representation of women in politics. It will show how gaining the right to vote was the foundation for broader political empowerment, but that there is still a gap in representation in government.

2. The Persistent Wage Gap: Economic Inequality
Story focus: This part will explore the continuing issue of the gender wage gap, focusing on how despite legal advances, women still earn less than men across most industries. The wage gap remains a critical barrier to true economic equality.

3. Law Mandates Equal Pay: Progress in Legislation
Story focus: This section will examine how many countries have introduced legislation requiring equal pay for work of equal value, but also point out the disconnect between legislation and its effective enforcement in many regions.

4. Motherhood and the Workforce: Balancing Care and Career
Story focus: Highlighting the challenges mothers face in balancing their professional careers and caregiving responsibilities. It will compare different countries' maternity and paternity leave policies and show how these policies impact women's long-term career prospects.

5. Legal Protections Against Violence: A Patchwork of Safeguards
Story focus: This section will explore the legal frameworks designed to protect women from violence, including domestic violence and child marriage. It will analyze how the presence or absence of these legal protections impacts women's safety and rights.

6. Cultural Challenges: Societal Norms vs. Legal Rights
Story focus: Even with strong legal protections, cultural attitudes often prevent real progress. This section will highlight societal beliefs that still justify violence against women, illustrating the cultural barriers that remain despite legal advancements.

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 


> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
