# User research 

## Target audience
 My goal is to reach a diverse audience that includes gender equality advocates, policy makers, educators, and people in leadership positions who have the ability to influence workplace policy. I chose this segment because they are in positions where they can drive meaningful change. I also wanted to engage young professionals and students interested in gender equality because they represent the next generation of changemakers. By focusing on data and storytelling, I intend to make the message relatable and impactful so that it sparks a conversation about the persistent gender gap. My goal is to not only raise awareness, but to inspire action, especially by those who can implement policies and practices that promote equality.
