# User research 

## Target audience
 My goal is to reach a diverse audience that includes gender equality advocates, policy makers, educators, and people in leadership positions who have the ability to influence workplace policy. I chose this segment because they are in positions where they can drive meaningful change. I also wanted to engage young professionals and students interested in gender equality because they represent the next generation of changemakers. By focusing on data and storytelling, I intend to make the message relatable and impactful so that it sparks a conversation about the persistent gender gap. My goal is to not only raise awareness, but to inspire action, especially by those who can implement policies and practices that promote equality.

## Interview findings
For each respondent, I chose people who I thought would provide a different perspective based on their background and expertise.
The student in her 20s was chosen because she was more likely to understand how a younger, socially conscious audience might interpret and emotionally resonate with the data. As a student with an interest in feminists and social justice, her feedback was helpful in gauging whether the content would resonate with millennials, who may be more vocal about gender inequality.
A human resources professional was chosen because of his extensive practical experience in workplace dynamics and gender policy. His feedback was valuable in understanding how the webpage could attract professionals in the business or corporate world, especially those who can influence policies related to gender equality.
Professors are chosen to provide an academic and research-oriented perspective, especially in gender studies. Their expertise allowed for a more in-depth assessment of the accuracy of the data, the fluency of the narrative, and the effectiveness of the visualization in presenting nuanced issues related to gender.
By selecting these three participants, I ensured a balance between emotional engagement, practical work perspectives, and academic expertise, all of which were important in achieving the goals of the webpage.

|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Interviewees felt transitions between sections were abrupt|I will add brief introductory sentences or contextual explanations before each new section to improve narrative flow|
|Wage gap chart was complex and needed more explanation|I will include a short caption or text near the wage gap chart explaining how to interpret the data and its significance|
|The color scheme was considered cluttered|I will adjust the color scheme to make it cleaner and easier to read, ensuring better contrast and consistency|
|Desire for more case studies or real-world examples|I will add case studies or anecdotes related to the wage gap and domestic violence statistics to humanize the data|
|Connections between sections could be clearer|I will ensure each section is tied together with clearer transitions and references to prior sections for coherence|

Feedback from the interviews highlighted several areas for improvement, which could enhance the visualization and accessibility of the data. By adding clearer explanations, smoothing transitions between sections, and refining the design of the visualizations, I will make the pages more engaging and understandable to a wider range of readers. Additionally, adding real-world case studies will create a deeper emotional connection and make the statistics more relatable, thus enhancing the overall impact of the project.
